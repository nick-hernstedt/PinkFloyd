                                    on 21 January 1977 through Harvest and Columbia Records. It was recorded at the
                                    band's
                                    Britannia Row Studios in London throughout 1976, and was produced by the band.
                                    The album
                                    continues the longform compositions that made up their previous works, including
                                    Wish You
                                    Were Here (1975). The album received positive reviews from critics and was
                                    commercially
                                    successful, reaching number 2 and 3 in the UK and US, respectively.

                                    Animals is a concept album focusing on the social-political conditions of late
                                    1970s
                                    Britain, and was a change from the style of their earlier work. Tension within

                                    during production later culminated in keyboardist Richard Wright leaving. The
                                    album's cover
                                    shows an inflatable pig floating between two chimneys of the Battersea Power
                                    Station,
                                    conceived by the band's bassist and lead songwriter Roger Waters, and was
                                    designed by
                                    long-time collaborator Storm Thorgerson. The band released no singles from the
                                    record, but
                                    promoted it through the In The Flesh tour. Waters' agitation with the crowd
                                    during this tour
                                    inspired their next record, The Wall (1979).</p>

                                    English
                                    progressive
                                    rock band Pink Floyd, released on 28 March 1994 by EMI Records in the United
                                    Kingdom and on
                                    4 April by Columbia Records in the United States.

                                    The second Pink Floyd album recorded without founding member Roger Waters, The
                                    Division Bell
                                    was written mostly by guitarist and singer David Gilmour and keyboardist Richard
                                    Wright. It
                                    features Wright's first lead vocal on a Pink Floyd album since The Dark Side of
                                    the Moon
                                    (1973). Gilmour's fiancée, novelist Polly Samson, co-wrote many of the lyrics,
                                    which deal
                                    with themes of communication. It was the last Pink Floyd album recorded with
                                    Wright, who
                                    died in 2008.

                                    Recording took place in locations including the band's Britannia Row Studios and
                                    Gilmour's
                                    houseboat, Astoria. The production team included longtime Pink Floyd
                                    collaborators such as
                                    producer Bob Ezrin, engineer Andy Jackson, saxophonist Dick Parry, and bassist
                                    Guy Pratt.

                                    The Division Bell received mixed reviews, but reached number one in more than 10
                                    countries,
                                    including the UK and the US. It was certified double platinum in the US the year
                                    it was
                                    released, and triple platinum in 1999. It was followed by a tour of the US and
                                    Europe.
                                    Unused material from the Division Bell sessions became part of Pink Floyd's next
                                    album, The
                                    Endless River (2014).</p>

                                        Floyd, released
                                        on 31 October 1971 by Harvest Records. The album was produced between the band's
                                        touring
                                        commitments, from January to August 1971 at a series of locations around London,
                                        including
                                        Abbey Road Studios and Morgan Studios.

                                        With no material to work with and no clear idea of the album's direction, the
                                        band devised a
                                        series of novel experiments which eventually inspired the album's signature
                                        track "Echoes".
                                        Although the band's later albums would be unified by a central theme with lyrics
                                        written
                                        entirely by Roger Waters, Meddle was a group effort with lyrical contributions
                                        from each
                                        member, and is considered a transitional album between the Syd
                                        Barrett-influenced group of
                                        the late 1960s and the emerging Pink Floyd.[1] The cover has been explained by
                                        its creator
                                        Storm Thorgerson to be an ear underwater;[2] as with several previous albums
                                        designed by
                                        Hipgnosis, though, Thorgerson was unhappy with the final result.

                                        The album was well-received by critics upon its release, and was commercially
                                        successful in
                                        the United Kingdom, but lackluster publicity on the part of the band's American
                                        label
                                        Capitol Records led to poor sales there upon initial release.</p>

                                            reached number 55 in the US, eventually going gold there.[3] A remastered CD
                                            was
                                            released in 1994 in the UK and the United States, and again in 2011. Ron
                                            Geesin, who had
                                            already influenced and collaborated with Roger Waters, contributed to the
                                            title track
                                            and received a then-rare outside songwriting credit.

                                            The cover was designed by Hipgnosis, and was the first one to not feature
                                            the band's
                                            name on the cover, or contain any photographs of the band anywhere. This was
                                            a trend
                                            that would continue on subsequent covers throughout the 1970s and beyond.

                                            Although it was commercially successful on release, the band, particularly
                                            Waters and
                                            David Gilmour, have expressed several negative opinions of the album in more
                                            recent
                                            years.[4][5] Nevertheless, it remained popular enough for Gilmour to perform
                                            the title
                                            track with Geesin in 2008.</p>

                                            album by
                                            English
                                            rock band Pink Floyd, released 4 August 1967 by EMI Columbia.[3] The only
                                            album made
                                            under founding member Syd Barrett's leadership, it takes its title from
                                            chapter seven of
                                            Kenneth Grahame's The Wind in the Willows, and was recorded at EMI Studios
                                            in London
                                            from February to May 1967 with producer Norman Smith.

                                            In the United States, the album was released in October on Tower Records,
                                            with an
                                            altered track listing that omitted three songs and included the UK non-album
                                            single "See
                                            Emily Play". In the UK, no singles were released from the album, but in the
                                            US,
                                            "Flaming" was offered as a single. Two of its songs, "Astronomy Domine" and
                                            "Interstellar Overdrive", became long-term mainstays of the band's live
                                            setlist, while
                                            other songs were performed live only a handful of times. Since its release,
                                            the album
                                            has been hailed as a pivotal psychedelic rock album.

                                            In 1973, the album was packaged with the band's second album A Saucerful of
                                            Secrets
                                            (1968) and released as A Nice Pair to introduce new fans to the band's early
                                            work after
                                            the success of The Dark Side of the Moon (1973). Special limited editions of
                                            The Piper
                                            at the Gates of Dawn were issued to mark its thirtieth, fortieth, and
                                            fiftieth
                                            anniversaries, with the former two releases containing bonus tracks. In
                                            2012, The Piper
                                            at the Gates of Dawn was placed at number 347 on Rolling Stone magazine's
                                            list of the
                                            "500 Greatest Albums of All Time".</p>

                                            Pink Floyd.
                                            It is a double album and was released on 7 November 1969 by Harvest
                                            Records.[4] The
                                            first disc consists of live recordings from concerts at Mothers Club in
                                            Birmingham
                                            and the College of Commerce in Manchester that contained part of their

                                            member of the
                                            band recorded at Abbey Road Studios.[5][6] The artwork was designed by
                                            regular Floyd
                                            collaborators Hipgnosis and features a number of pictures of the band
                                            combined to
                                            give a Droste effect. It was the last album cover to feature the band.

                                            Although the album was well received at the time of release, and was a
                                            top five hit
                                            in the UK album charts, it has since been looked upon unfavourably by
                                            the band, who
                                            have expressed negative opinions about it in interviews. Nevertheless,
                                            the album has
                                            been reissued on CD several times, along with the rest of their
                                            catalogue.</p>

                                        <p class="card-text p-2">The Final Cut is the twelfth studio album by English
                                            rock band Pink
                                            Floyd, released on 21 March 1983 in the United Kingdom and on 2 April in
                                            the United
                                            States through Harvest and Columbia Records. It comprises unused
                                            material from the
                                            previous Pink Floyd record, The Wall (1979), alongside new material
                                            recorded
                                            throughout 1982.

                                            The Final Cut was the last Pink Floyd album to feature founding member
                                            Roger Waters,
                                            who departed in 1985. It is also the only Pink Floyd album not to
                                            feature founding
                                            member and keyboardist Richard Wright, whom Waters fired during the Wall
                                            sessions.
                                            The recording was plagued by conflict; guitarist David Gilmour felt many
                                            of the
                                            tracks were not worthy of inclusion, but Waters accused him of failing
                                            to contribute
                                            material himself. Drummer Nick Mason's contributions were mostly limited
                                            to sound
                                            effects.

                                            Waters planned the album as a soundtrack for the 1982 film adaptation of
                                            The Wall.
                                            With the onset of the Falklands War, he rewrote it as a concept album
                                            exploring what
                                            he considered the betrayal of his father, who died serving in the Second
                                            World War.
                                            Waters provided lead vocals for all but one track, and he is credited
                                            for all
                                            songwriting. The album was accompanied by a short film released in the
                                            same year.

                                            The Final Cut received mixed reviews, though retrospective reception has
                                            been more
                                            favourable. It was a commercial success, reaching number one in the UK
                                            and number
                                            six in the US.</p>

                                        <p class="card-text p-2">Obscured by Clouds is the seventh studio album by the
                                            English
                                            progressive rock band Pink Floyd, released on 2 June 1972 by Harvest and
                                            Capitol
                                            Records. It is based on their soundtrack for the French film La Vallée,
                                            by Barbet
                                            Schroeder. It was recorded in two sessions in France, while they were in
                                            the midst
                                            of touring, and produced by the band members.

                                            The album is noticeably shorter than some of their previous material,
                                            and makes
                                            heavy use of the acoustic guitar. Lyrically, the songs centre around
                                            love, a common
                                            theme in the film it was inspired by. The album's only single, "Free
                                            Four", was
                                            released in the US only.

                                            Obscured by Clouds is often seen as a stopgap for the band, who had
                                            started work on
                                            their next album, The Dark Side of the Moon (1973). The work is often
                                            overlooked in
                                            the band canon, primarily because of the success of their later
                                            material.
                                            Nevertheless, the album reached number six in the UK and number 46 in
                                            the US, and
                                            retrospective opinions from both fans and critics have been positive,
                                            with some
                                            critics noting the similarities to their later material.</p>
